## Devlog F0

## How We Satisfied the Software Requirements

**[F0.a]** You control a character moving over a 2D grid.  
- The character moves around in a 2D grid, progressing from cell to cell, as opposed to more free-form movement.

**[F0.b]** You advance time manually in the turn-based simulation.  
- There is a "Next Turn" button that increments the turn counter and affects the growth, water, and sun levels of the cells.

**[F0.c]** You can reap or sow plants on grid cells only when you are near them.  
- A popup appears when you are near the dirt planter boxes, allowing you to plant. After planting, you can then reap the cells that have plants on them.

**[F0.d]** Grid cells have sun and water levels. The incoming sun and water for each cell are randomly generated each turn.  
- Sun energy cannot be stored in a cell (it is used immediately or lost), while water moisture can accumulate over several turns.  
- Each cell has a water and sun level. The sun level is a new randomly generated value each turn (it does not persist), while water is slowly added until it reaches a maximum of 5, where it is considered full.

**[F0.e]** Each plant on the grid has a distinct type (e.g., one of 3 species) and a growth level (e.g., “level 1”, “level 2”, “level 3”).  
- You can place wheat, aloe vera, or flytrap, each with different sun and water requirements.  
- The plants have growth levels that can be viewed in the `plants.json` file.

**[F0.f]** Simple spatial rules govern plant growth based on sun, water, and nearby plants. Growth is unlocked by satisfying specific conditions.  
- We have defined a JSON structure that describes plant growth levels and their requirements.  
- Every time a turn is taken, a function evaluates all plants on the grid against the requirements for their next growth level. If a plant meets the requirements, its growth level is increased.

**[F0.g]** A play scenario is completed when some condition is satisfied (e.g., at least X plants at growth level Y or above).  
- We have used JSON to describe the structure for completing a given 'level.'  
- Every time a turn is taken, a function evaluates the current game state against the level requirements. If the requirements are not met, the level is not passed.

## Reflection

We initially wanted to use YAML to hold our data, as we found the format to be more human-readable. However, we ultimately decided on JSON because it is much easier to parse in a frontend environment. The project itself took about 4 hours to complete (before refactoring) and was not very challenging. If we were to approach this section of the project again, we would likely implement better systems diagrams, as they would have bridged the gap between programmers when implementing things themselves. We would also likely engage in much more pair programming, as we found that solo sessions were less productive than pair sessions. 

One issue we encountered was with pre-commit hooks in our environment. Deno does not recognize PNGs as an import type. Even when adding something like `declare module '*png'` to the `index.d.ts` file, we were unable to resolve the error Deno gave us, stating "module ... has no default export." After researching the issue, it was concluded that it's not possible to suppress this linter error, so the hooks were ultimately refactored to avoid linting files on push. This is an issue we are still working to resolve, and we hope to find a fix soon.
