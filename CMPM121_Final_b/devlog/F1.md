## How We Satisfied the Software Requirements For F0 and F1

**[F0.a]** You control a character moving over a 2D grid.  
- The character moves around in a 2D grid, progressing from cell to cell, as opposed to more free-form movement.

**[F0.b]** You advance time manually in the turn-based simulation.  
- There is a "Next Turn" button that increments the turn counter and affects the growth, water, and sun levels of the cells.

**[F0.c]** You can reap or sow plants on grid cells only when you are near them.  
- A popup appears when you are near the dirt planter boxes, allowing you to plant. After planting, you can then reap the cells that have plants on them.

**[F0.d]** Grid cells have sun and water levels. The incoming sun and water for each cell are randomly generated each turn.  
- Sun energy cannot be stored in a cell (it is used immediately or lost), while water moisture can accumulate over several turns.  
- Each cell has a water and sun level. The sun level is a new randomly generated value each turn (it does not persist), while water is slowly added until it reaches a maximum of 5, where it is considered full.

**[F0.e]** Each plant on the grid has a distinct type (e.g., one of 3 species) and a growth level (e.g., “level 1”, “level 2”, “level 3”).  
- You can place wheat, aloe vera, or flytrap, each with different sun and water requirements.  
- The plants have growth levels that can be viewed in the `plants.json` file.

**[F0.f]** Simple spatial rules govern plant growth based on sun, water, and nearby plants. Growth is unlocked by satisfying specific conditions.  
- We have defined a JSON structure that describes plant growth levels and their requirements.  
- Every time a turn is taken, a function evaluates all plants on the grid against the requirements for their next growth level. If a plant meets the requirements, its growth level is increased.

**[F0.g]** A play scenario is completed when some condition is satisfied (e.g., at least X plants at growth level Y or above).  
- We have used JSON to describe the structure for completing a given 'level.'  
- Every time a turn is taken, a function evaluates the current game state against the level requirements. If the requirements are not met, the level is not passed.

**[F1.a]** The important state of your game's grid must be backed by a single contiguous byte array in AoS or SoA format. If your game stores the grid state in multiple format, the byte array format must be the primary format (i.e. other formats are decoded from it as needed).
-In PlantController.ts, we have an AoS format with arraybuffers and it is decoded with a dataview that reads from the low level arraybuffer and gives back the plant data. The arraybuffer is used to store the plant cells and getting the arraybuffer with getArrayBuffer() returns back the data that matches the cell interface. 
You can see this more in the diagram below:

**[F1.b]** The player must be able to manually save their progress in the game. This must allow them to load state and continue play another day (i.e. after quitting the game app). The player must be able to manage multiple save files/slots.
-There is a save button loaded in and there is a load button as well. There is localStorage that saves your progress even when you quit and there are 4 save slots in total. You can then press the load button to load from the save.  

**[F1.c]** The game must implement an implicit auto-save system to support recovery from unexpected quits. (For example, when the game is launched, if an auto-save entry is present, the game might ask the player "do you want to continue where you left off?" The auto-save entry might or might not be visible among the list of manual save entries available for the player to load as part of F1.b.)
-After the turn button is pressed, it is saved to local storage. There is an auto save system that saves based off of local storage and isn't visible. The auto save will still work as it is based on local storage and you exit out of the game. 

**[F1.d]** The player must be able to undo every major choice (all the way back to the start of play), even from a saved game. They should be able to redo (undo of undo operations) multiple times.
-There is a command pipeline that can undo and redo. It is then applied so it's applied to actions such as reap and sow along with decrementing the turn counter if it needs to go down by adding on top of the undo and redo. You can spam the undo and redo button over and over again without any issues if you start from a saved game. We are currently working on a way to undo and redo even from a saved game with an action stack and a redo stack. If the stacks are persistent, it should be able to called from the stack to undo and redo from local storage. 

## Reflection
Looking back on how you achieved the new F1 requirements, how has your team’s plan changed? Did you reconsider any of the choices you previously described for Tools and Materials or your Roles? Has your game design evolved now that you've started to think about giving the player more feedback? It would be very suspicious if you didn’t need to change anything. There’s learning value in you documenting how your team’s thinking has changed over time.

Our team's plan hasn't really changed since the new F1 requirements. Nothing has really changed in terms of tools or materials and our roles are still the same. Our game design has changed so that players will be able to load and reload the scenes and we are now testing the game so that it makes sense for new players. It also caused us to question what undo and redo should do for this and we landed on it being able to undo your actions as well as decrementing your turn if possible. Since it's strange as of now, the undo and redo isn't what we have in mind and we plan to change it so that the undo and redo applies to the actions and turn counter when you come back. We are now thinking of ways to make sure the load and saves make sense and think about where we should but buttons and display information as well.
