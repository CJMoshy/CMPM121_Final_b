## Devlog F2

### F0+F1
The previous requirements for F0 and F1 remain satisfied with our F2 implementation. The biggest change between previous iterations and this iteration is the switch to an alternate platform, from Phaser to React. The switch away from Phaser did take away some animations and UI, but this implementation still fulfills all requirements. Using React did change our code for the better, using hooks to more seamlessly share data between files. Certain components can be used between multiple files for more streamlined usage, such as with plants and all their relevant data.

### External DSL for Scenario Design
Our external DSL is JSON. Our game has levels in which players must meet specific requirements, revolving around having a certain number of specified plants at a specific growth level. Here is an example of a level in our game:
```
"levelNum": 2,
"requirements": {
    "plants": {
        "Flytrap": {
        "amount": 1,
        "growthLevel": 3
        },
        "Wheat": {
        "amount": 1,
        "growthLevel": 2
        }
    }
}

```
This snippet is somewhat self explanatory in its requirements. Each requirement is labeled with the required plant, and the amount needed at a certain growth level. This is level 2, which requires 1 Flytrap at growth level 3, and 1 Wheat at growth level 2. This external DSL can be modified, either by changing existing levels or creating more levels at the end of the levels array.

### Internal DSL for Plants and Growth Conditions
Our internal DSL uses Typescript, and can be found in the PlantDSL.ts file. Here is a code excerpt from our internal DSL: 
```
Plant.named("Wheat").growsWhen([
    {
      sunlevel: 3,
      waterlevel: 2,
      proximity: 1,
    },
    { sunlevel: 5, waterlevel: 3, proximity: 3 },
    {
      sunlevel: 5,
      waterlevel: 4,
      proximity: 5,
    },
  ]),
```
This is an example of our internal dsl in use. It defines a high level format for creating types of plants and thier growth rates.

### Switch to Alternate Platform
In this version of our final project, we switched from using Phaser to using React. Some of our code was able to be carried over, such as the logic for generating sun and water levels, or the the AoS buffer. Using React allowed for components (such as plant data) to be used in multiple files, making for a more streamlined coding process. This is something that we used to some extent in this implementation of the project, and we think that this will be just as useful, if not more, in future implementations of our project. Changing platforms did cause some concepts to be redesigned for the better, such as components being used in multiple files as mentioned before. In the future, we also plan to use React to easily transition into creating a mobile implementation of our game. The main conclusion that we came to from changing our platform was that switching away from Phaser did make our game less visually interesting, but switching to React made for a more robust codebase. 

## Reflection
The switch from Phaser to React did change up some of our team's plans. We moved away from a focus on visual presentation, and more towards a stronger code base (as stated in the switch to alternate platform section). This caused some shift in our roles, such as the design lead putting more focus on the coding portion of the game. This change in platform also took some getting used to between group members. Phaser was a platform that all members had experience with, coming from CMPM 120. However, some members weren't well versed with React, which caused some extra time spent getting used to the platform. Despite this, we all agree that the use of React will make our game better in the long run, and will enhance our game with React in mind. On the player feedback side of things, the de-emphasis on visual presentation means that certain actions give the player less feedback despite the better codebase. As we move forward with React, we will look into providing more player feedback that aligns with the improved codebase.
